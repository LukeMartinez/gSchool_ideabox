## Idea Box

Idea Box was my first web application. It is a project I completed about 2 months into gSchool. The goal for the project was to learn how to sort, filter, and search for simple objects.


###Refactoring

In the 3 months since doing this project, I have made leaps and bounds in my understanding of ruby and OOP. The best decision I could make in regards to refactoring this project would be to rewrite it completely. However, I thought it would be a good exercise to go through and see what I could do with it in the current implementation.

- Take styling tags out of views and put them in a stylsheet.
- Extract partials
- Simplify or remove business logic from view templates.
- Refactor complex or confusing methods.
